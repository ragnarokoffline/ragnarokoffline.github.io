Hi, I'm [wrywndp](https://www.youtube.com/@wrywndp).\
This is a GitHub page for hosting a manual guide to ready-to-play Ragnarok Offline Pre-Renewal from my YouTube Channel.\
This incluse on how to install, download links, troubleshooting, and custom changes.\
This project is solely for testing and educational purposes.\
Everything is free, and I'm not asking for any kind of donation or doing any monetization.\
So, please be aware of anyone who would like to get your money from this project.

## How to install?
Go to https://ragnarokoffline.github.io/

## Minimum Specification
This spec is required to run Laragon 6.0.0 (PHP, Apache, MariaDB, and NginX), rAthena (Emulator), and Ragnarok Offline Client.
| Type | Minimum | Recommended |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| CPU | 2 Cores | 4 Cores |
| RAM | 4GB | 8GB |
| GPU | DirectX 8.1 | DirectX 11/12 <sup>[1]</sup> |
| VRAM | 1GB | 2GB |

Note:
* I'm using dgVoodoo2 and set it to default to bypass Ragnarok Client FPS and resolution limitation. If you have any graphical issues please read the manual to fix them. <sup>[1]</sup>
* I created this pack using Windows 11 24H2 and also tested it on Windows 10 22H2. So, I CAN NOT guarantee this pack will run without a problem on an older system. <sup>[2]</sup>
